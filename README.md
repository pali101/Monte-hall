# Monty Hall Problem Simulator

This Python script simulates the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle. The Monty Hall problem involves a game show host, three doors, and a prize behind one of the doors. The player initially chooses a door, and then the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. The player is then given the option to either stick with their initial choice or switch to the other unopened door. The goal is to maximize the chances of winning.

## About the Script

The script uses a random number generator to simulate the door selection and the host's actions. It keeps track of the number of wins when swapping the chosen door and when not swapping the chosen door.

The script prompts the user to enter their initial door choice (0, 1, or 2) and whether they want to swap or not. Based on the user's input and the simulated game show host's actions, the script determines if the user has won or lost.
